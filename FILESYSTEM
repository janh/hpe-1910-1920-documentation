General parameters (fixed):

Erase block size: 0x10000
Filesystem size: 0x1cf0000

Filesystem block size: 0x400
Filesystem blocks per erase block: 64 (first is used for file allocation table, rest is used for data)



File allocation table
=====================

The first filesystem block within each erase block is used for part of the file allocation table.
It contains an entry for every of the following 63 data blocks in the erase block.
Each 8-byte entry has the following format:


0x0	Flags, 1 byte
	0x3f: valid (has data)
	0xff: invalid (unused block)

0x1	Previous block index, 3 bytes
	0xffffff: invalid (first block of file data or directory entries)

0x4	Reserved, 1 byte
	0xff

0x5	Next block index, 3 bytes
	0xffffff: invalid (last block of file data or directory entries)


Calculate flash offset of data block from block index:
0x10000 * (i // 63) + 0x400 * (1 + (i % 63))

Calculate flash offset of file allocation table entry from block index:
0x10000 * (i // 63) + 0x8 * (i % 63)


The first 4 bytes of the filesystem contain the format flag.
Value: 0x10000400 (bits 31-12: erase block size, bits 11-0: block size)
(This would otherwise contain the first 4 bytes of the file allocation table entry for block index 0. This block is known to always be valid and contain the root directory entry.)


The filesystem data block at index 0 (i.e. at flash offset 0x400) contains the root directory, i.e. a single file entry with exactly the following values:
flags = 0x3f
parent block index = 0
first data block index = 1



File entry (128 bytes)
======================

By default, values are all-ones (i.e. flash block has been erased but not yet programmed).
This also means that flags are inverted (i.e. a flag is set if its bit is zero).


0x0	Flags, 1 byte
	free: 0x80 (set at start of entry creation)
	valid: 0x40 (set after creation of entry is finished)
	invalid: 0x20 (set when an entry is deleted)
	hide: 0x10
	directory: 0x02
	read-only: 0x01
	(for a regular file, the value is 0x3f)

0x6	Year, 2 bytes

0x8	Month, 1 byte

0x9	Day, 1 byte

0xa	Hour, 1 byte

0xb	Minute, 1 byte

0xc	Second, 1 byte

0x10	File length, 4 bytes

0x14	Parent block index, 4 bytes

0x18	Parent entry index within block, 2 bytes

0x1c	First data block index, 4 bytes
	for a file, the referenced block contains the start of the file data
	for a directory, the referenced block contains the first file entries in the directory

0x20	Name, 96 bytes
	null-terminated string
