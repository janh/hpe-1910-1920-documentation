0xc24	RSA signature length, 4 bytes
        typically 256

0xc28	RSA signature Reserved, 8 bytes
        seems to be all zeroes

	CRC-16/XMODEM over header (first 6176 bytes)



File descriptor (24 bytes)
==========================

0x0	Type, 4 bytes
	identical to value from file header

0x4	Offset, 4 bytes
	address of file header

0x8	Length, 4 bytes
	including file header

0xc	File CRC, 4 bytes
	identical to value from file header

0x10	Version, 4 bytes
	identical to value from file header

0x14	Type mask, 4 bytes
	seems to be 0xFFFFFFFF for Basic Bootware, 0x1 for others



File header (340 bytes)
=======================

0x0	Reserved, 4 bytes
	all zeroes

0x4	Header CRC, 4 bytes
	CRC-16/XMODEM over file header (last 332 bytes)

	0x04000000: Application (required)
	0x05000000: Extended BootWare
	0x05000001: Basic BootWare

0xc	Version, 4 bytes
	typically 0x1 for application, for BootWare two 2 byte numbers

0x10	Product ID, 4 bytes
	same as in main header

0x14	Device ID, 4 bytes
	matches value in main header for application, 0x1 for BootWare

0x18	Length without padding, 4 bytes
	files seem to be padded with zero-bytes to a multiple of 8 bytes
	(value seems not to be read)

0x1c	Version offset, 4 bytes
	offset of version number within file or 0xFFFFFFFF (seems to contain valid value only for BootWare)
