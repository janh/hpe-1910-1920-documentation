- Application image is extracted to 0xa0100000 (offset 0x100000 within RAM), bootloader then jump to that address

- System LED seems to be connected to a watchdog (looks like there is a Pericom PT7A7514 on the board)
  configuring a non-blinking mode in LED_GLB_CTRL results in a reboot about a second later
  (the bootloader sets the value 1 and it implements rebooting by disabling the system LED and looping until reset)

- On RTL838x the actual power LED is connected to GPIO 36 of the RTL8231 on the LED board (active low)
  (in the bootloader it is controlled via bits 0-4 of LED_SW_CTRL (a00c): 0xd to turn it off, 0x8 to turn it on)

- On RTL839x the actual power LED is connected to GPIO 9 of the SoC (active high)
  (in the bootloader it is controlled via bit 17 of 0xb800350c: 0 to turn it off, 1 to turn it on)

- Booting image from RAM will update the Basic and/or Extended BootWare on flash if the image contains a newer version!
  (if it isn't set already it also writes a flag to flash that last boot was from RAM)
